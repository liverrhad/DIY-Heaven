                <p class='content_text'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Malnutrition by definition is the lack of proper nutrition. This lack of proper nutrition is caused by not eating enough in general or just not eating enough of the foods that you body needs to function properly.  Malnutrition is a large issue in in the United States as well as other places around the world. Many children in the United States suffer from malnutrition not only due to the lack of food on people's tables but also a lack of nutrition in the food that they do eat.<br />
                    <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In children malnutrition is quite dangerous to their long term health. When children suffer from malnutrition they often do not grow at the expected rate of their age group in both weight and height. There may also be a significant change in mood and/or behavior. They may seem more irritable and angry. It is even possible for them to experience a change in skin or hair color.<br />
                    <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In adults malnutrition can cause the weakening of muscles and fatigue. Your muscle will seem to waste away as you continue to have less and less energy to perform seemingly simple tasks throughout the day. Malnutrition also weakens your immune system making you more susceptible to disease and infection. As well as lengthening the recovery process for infection, diseases, and wounds. It can also affect your concentration as it worsens and makes it really difficult to focus on certain things. Along with that you lose motivation to even get out of bed and it can eventually lead to depression. Malnutrition can lead to permanent mental and physical health issues.<br />
                    <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In America today malnutrition is becoming an exceedingly larger problem especially in children. If you experience any of the symptoms described previously, take a look at your diet. Are you getting all of the required vitamins and minerals for the day? Maybe you are not getting enough protein. Make sure that you and your family are getting all of the necessary vitamins and minerals daily. Also think about how you can help people in your community with issues of malnutrition. Regularly donate to your local food bank with nonperishable nutrient rich foods. Offer to lend a hand at a soup kitchen to help the less fortunate receive well needed nutrition.<br />
